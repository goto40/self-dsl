# Xtext and Eclipse

Xtext is integrated in Eclipse.
To run this tutorial (using Xtext) you need to install Eclipse with the 
appropriate plugins.

Note: The parser "Antlr" is not distributed with eclipse. You need to install
it manually [(itemis update site)](http://download.itemis.de/updates),
else it will be downloaded for every Xtext project you create.

## Download and install

Download and install [eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/download.html) ("Eclipse Modelling Tools" and the XText Plugins).
