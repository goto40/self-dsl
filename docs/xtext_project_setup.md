# Xtext Project Setup

## Goal

In this section you will learn

 * How to create a new XText Project.
 * How to run you toolchain (editor and parser).
 * What Project structures are created.
 * Run a unittest testing the parser.
 * Optional: How to start a build of your toolchain with maven at the 
   command line

## Step 1: Create a new Xtext Project

Follow section "Create A New Xtext Project"
in ::namedref::(references.md#xtext15min).

In addition to the information from the tutorial we
suggest the following details for the other examples
discussed on this site:
![model.dot](images/xtext_new_project2.png "xtext_new_project2.png")

The result are a set of projects: we are mainly interested in the
first project, which contains the grammar.

## Step 2: Exploring the new domain model language

The example grammar (automatically created after project
initialization) defines a "Model" consisting of 
"Greetings" is shown in the following. A "Model" contains "Greetings".
Every "Greeting" consists of the Text 'Hello' and a name followed by '!'
(details below).

    ::antlr
    grammar org.example.domainmodel.Domainmodel with
                                      org.eclipse.xtext.common.Terminals
    generate domainmodel "http://www.example.org/domainmodel/Domainmodel"

    Model:
        greetings+=Greeting*;
      
    Greeting:
        'Hello' name=ID '!';


::uml:: format="svg" classes="uml GreetingMetaModel" alt="Greeting Meta Model"
class Model {
}
class Greeting {
  name
}
Model *- "n" Greeting
::end-uml::

Notes:

 * "+=" denotes the owner relationship of one Model containing many Greetings 
    (__composition__).
 * "name=ID" defines an attribute "name" of the Rule "Greeting" (allowing to 
    define model elements of the type "Greeting"; __attributes__ of 
    __model elements__).
 * The attribute name has a special meaning by default, to denote the 
    identifier of the Rule (__identification of model elements__).
 * ID is a terminal (like INT, STRING, etc.; see grammar, and click "F3" on
      "org.eclipse.xtext.common.Terminals" to see definition).
   "name=ID" means that the attribute "name" is parsed as "ID" (which in turn
   is - more or less - an alphanumerical word staring with no number)

### Note on version control

When using git or svn make sure not to commit any generated code
(e.g. everything under src-gen and xtend-gen). Use, e.g., a .gitignore file
like the following:

    target
    src-gen
    xtend-gen
    .settings
    .metadata
    bin
    generated

## Step 3: Compile and Run the Project
::namedref::{xtext_compile_and_run:Compile and Run the Project}: Without 
modifing the grammar (or anything else), follow the steps in
section "Generate Language Artifacts" in 
::namedref::(references.md#xtext15min).

After this, you can use explore the editor and enter a model according to 
the example meta model grammar provided by the Xtext project setup. 

Now you can play with your new language (type CTRL-Space to get auto
completion). Enter the following example:

    ::raw
    Hello Pierre!
    Hello Tim!
    Hello Markus!

## Step 5: Add Unittests

In the test project you can add a unittests. Locate the single file in
the src folder. This file contains a unittest. Uncomment the test code and
run the test. 

Note: You need to generate the xtext artifact before (see above).


You may extend the default test code by adding the following:

    ::xtend
    @Inject extension
    ParseHelper<Model> parseHelper
    @Inject extension
    ValidationTestHelper validationHelper

The you can easily check that no errors occurred while parsing:

    ::xtend
    package org.xtext.example.mydsl.tests
    
    ...
        
    @RunWith(XtextRunner)
    @InjectWith(MyDslInjectorProvider)
    class MyDslParsingTest {
        @Inject extension
        ParseHelper<Model> parseHelper
        @Inject extension
        ValidationTestHelper validationHelper
        
        @Test
        def void loadModel() {
            val result = parseHelper.parse('''
                Hello Xtext!
            ''')
            Assert.assertNotNull(result)
            result.assertNoErrors
        }
    }

## Optional step 5: Build meta model using maven

When maven is selected as build tool, you can also use maven (instead of
eclipse) to build your project on the command line: Go to the "parent" 
project and run "mvn package".

Maven will download all required packages in "~/.m2" (locally) and then build 
your sub-projects. The output is located in the folder "target" of each 
sub-project.

Hint: When using the Xtext version shipped with the Photon eclipse version 
in September 2018, I got an error reported by maven which I solved by inserting 
a small snippet to correct
a version (everything between <dependencies\> and </dependencies\>,
see [https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1231](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1231).

    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.eclipse.xtend</groupId>
        <artifactId>xtend-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${xtextVersion}</version>
        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.eclipse.platform</groupId>
                <artifactId>org.eclipse.equinox.common</artifactId>
                <version>3.10.0</version>
